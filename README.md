# kanban_board_spring_td
Discovering Spring &amp; Spring Boot developing a Kanban Board

---

Following the steps indicated in the subject, I did steps 1 & 2 : all unit tests are passing.

I started the third step implementing Developer, Task and TaskStatus Services but it's not working properly at the moment : only 50% of the unit tests are passing.
